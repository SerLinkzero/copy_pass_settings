# Copy Pass Settings

This simple Blender addon copies the render pass settings of the current view layer to any selected ones in the file.

A new panel named `Copy Pass Settings` is added to the View Layer Properties. The UI should be quite self-explanatory.

Don’t forget to update the view layer list before running.

## Installation

Download  [copy_pass_settings_v0.0.1.zip](https://github.com/SerLinkzero/copy_pass_settings/releases/latest) and install from Blender’s Preferences.
